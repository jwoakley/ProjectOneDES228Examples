                <li><strong>Kyoto, Japan</strong></li>                    
                <p>My favorite city in Japan. I love the culture, the food, the scenery—everything is amazing!</p>
        
                <li><strong>Marina Bay Sands, Singapore</strong></li>                
                <P>One of the most beautiful pieces of architecture in Singapore. It’s even better to be on top of it, drinking and hanging out with friends.</P>                
        
                <li><strong>Busan, Korea</strong></li>                
                <p>We go here once a year for training. They have great food, great culture, and cool tourist spots as well.</p>
                
        
                <li><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong></li>                
                <p>It was so cool to get up close with a kangaroo and take a selfie. I’m surprised by how big they really are in person and how buff they look.</p>
                
        
                <li><strong>Monster Building, Hong Kong</strong></li>                
                <p>This building is a popular tourist spot in Hong Kong. The way it’s structured is very unique, and when you stand in the middle of it, the whole thing feels so massive, just like a monster.</p>

                <li><strong>Ronald Raegan, CVN-76</strong></li>
                <p>Experienced working on a flight deck during flight schedules. It is very cool to see, but it can also get scary and stressful at times.</p>
                
                <li><strong>EA18G-Growlers</strong></li>
                <p>Worked on this bad boy, and became a lead supervisor and quality assurance inspector for this aircraft.</p>

                <p>Rode on this giant cargo plane from Japan to Washington State. It was a very cool experience, but the whole flight was not comfortable at all—and it was very loud.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Refueling Mid Air</strong></li>
                <p>Got to experience and watch how refueling an aircraft mid-air is done. This was a very cool experience!</p>

                <P>Got to see a fleet of warships after a RIMPAC exercise. I’m glad it was just an exercise because it was crazy to see so many warships all together.</P>
