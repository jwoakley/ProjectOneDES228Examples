            <h1>Introducing Grace</h1>
            <p>Grace Davidson is a third year visual communications major and marketing minor here at San Francisco State University. 
                She started out at Academy of Art University in 2020 after taking a gap year but ended up switching to the community 
                college transfer path. Once Grace got her AA in Studio Arts she transferred to SFSU in early 2024. 
                <br><br>
                Grace was raised by a graphic designer and a filmmaker who nurtured her artistic creativity throughout her childhood,
                 cementing art as a major part of her life since she was a kid. However, it wasn't until after graduating high school 
                 that she realized she wanted to follow in her dad's footsteps and become a graphic designer. Growing up watching her 
                 dad do branding and packaging design always inspired Grace but she didn't necessarily see herself going into packaging 
                 design. As she got older, she began finding designers online who work in different fields like merchandising and publishing 
                 and she started to see herself possibly working in one of these fields in the future. Although she's not quite set on the specific 
                 industry she wants to work in, Grace is interested in branding, marketing, and typography, and would like to combine these 
                 with her other interests like music, television and movies.
                 <br><br>
                 Grace is 23 years old and she was born in Brooklyn, New York but moved to the Bay Area in 2008 and is now living in El Cerrito. 
                 Grace is a Cancer Sun and Moon and the oldest of two sisters. In her free time, you can find Grace doing arts and crafts, hanging 
                 out with her dog Linguini, and spending time with her boyfriend, friends, and family. She also enjoys trying new restaurants and 
                 bars and her favorite cuisines include Mexican, Japanese, and Italian (restaurant and bar recommendations are welcome!). When Grace 
                 is at home relaxing, she usually likes to watch TV shows including RuPaul's Drag Race, Sex and the City, and whatever new crime documentary is on Netflix.</p>
