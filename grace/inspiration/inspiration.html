                  <h3><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/charli-xcx/432942256">Charli XCX</a></h3>
                  <p>Charli XCX is a musician whose new album, BRAT, has been the soundtrack of my summer. 
                    I love the energy she creates with her music, the beats make me want to dance for hours 
                    but she's also able to thoughtfully communicate a relatable perspective through her lyrics. 
                    Charli XCX's music inspires me by making me feel confident and carefree. I'm also inspired 
                    by her visual branding from a graphic design standpoint, currently it's very minimal and 
                    focuses more on text and edgy imagery.</p>

                  <h3><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/chappell-roan/1264818718">Chappell Roan</a></h3>
                  <p>Chappell Roan is another musician whose music has been playing in my headphones all year. 
                    Her songs are so beautiful and moving, in both an emotional sense and a physical sense because 
                    they always get me dancing. Chappell's visual aesthetic is so fun and campy which I love. I also 
                    admire how unapologetic she is about setting boundaries for herself with fans and the public. 
                    Women in the entertainment industry are expected to just smile through all of the harassment 
                    they face so it's empowering to see Chappell put her foot down, I hope it inspires others to do the same.</p>

                  <p>Kel Lauren is a graphic designer who works in merchandising for musical artists. 
                    They are super talented and I've been following their work for a few years now. Kel's 
                    style is unique and eclectic, the FAQ on their website describes some of their work as 
                    “gas station chic.” I'm incredibly inspired by their body of work, it's experimental 
                    and bold yet very intricate and intentional. Not only does their eye for design inspire 
                    me, but I'm inspired to enter their specific field of graphic design. I'd love to combine 
                    my love for design with my love for music (and movies/TV).</p>

                  <h3><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></h3>
                  <p>When I need design inspiration, the first place I go to is Pinterest. It's my 
                    favorite resource to use when I'm trying to put together a mood board for a design 
                    project. I also like looking on Pinterest for references for paintings and drawings.</p>

                  <h3><a href="https://patriciafield.com">Patricia Field</a></h3>
                  <p>One of my favorite shows is <em>Sex and the City</em> and the fashion throughout 
                    the show inspires me no matter how many times I watch it. Patricia Field was the 
                    costume designer for the show and is responsible for so many iconic looks that I 
                    often flip through in my head when I'm putting an outfit together (although my outfit 
                    rarely lives up to the inspiration in my head). The different aesthetics that Field 
                    created resonate with me and inspire me not just in my own fashion attempts but in 
                    my visual art as well. </p>

                  <h3><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></h3>
                  <p>Pinterest is my go-to place for inspiration for many things, including fashion. 
                    I have a huge pinterest board for fashion that I created in high school and have 
                    been adding to ever since. Today this pinterest board has over 300 pins and it's 
                    so cool to scroll through them and see my style inspiration evolve over the years.</p>
