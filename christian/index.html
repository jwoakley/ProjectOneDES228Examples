      <h2>My Bio:</h2>
      <p>
        My path to design was unconventional. After initial design coursework, I
        devoted a year to developing my drawing skills and growing my social
        media presence as an artist. During this time, I developed my drawing
        practice which continues to inform my design portfolio development. If
        you’d like to see my artwork, feel free to find it
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CrisspyArt">here:</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        While also developing my drawing practice, I worked with and lead teams
        in a variety of fields at a property management organization. This
        developed my skills as a solid communicator, team player, and leader. I
        coordinated/scheduled, organized, and provided excellent customer
        service with a friendly and helpful attitude, resulting in a 50%
        increase in client satisfaction. This professional experience continues
        to inform my professional practices and I am able to meet any new
        challenge with agility.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I came back to school, I was reinvigorated when I worked on
        identity design projects. I view identity design as a form of
        storytelling that allows businesses to share their values and story. So,
        when I worked on my first rebrand project, it was my chance to help this
        business speak their truth and stand out from the crowd with my design
        skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gaming is a burning passion of mine because of the immersive
        storytelling potential and the branching pathways of each story
        highlighting multiple users. This passion informs my design practice as
        I see each brief as a possibility to engage diverse audiences through
        creative storytelling tactics and impactful visuals. My goal is to work
        on unique identities within the gaming industry.
