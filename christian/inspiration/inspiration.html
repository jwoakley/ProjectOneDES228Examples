      <h1>Here are some artists that I find inspiring.</h1>

          <h2>Jeremy Anninos</h2>

        </a>

        <p>
          For my first artist I chose Jeremy Anninos. He's an illustrator at
          Riot Games, and has been my personal standard of art quality that I
          want to try and meet. His rendering style is the main thing that I
          always love about his art, the simplicity of the values and shapes
          gives his work such strong confidence that I can only try and achieve.

          <h2>Bengal</h2>
          <img
            src="./img/bengal3.png"
            alt="A woman leans against her car with her jacket draped over her back."
          />
        </a>

        <p>
          For the 2nd artist, we have Bengal, a comic artist who has worked for
          about every single big publisher out there. Marvel, DC, Image, you
          name it, he's probably done work for them. The thing I really love
          about his art, is his use of 3-point perspective. He makes it look
          super easy and his work has so much extra depth and dynamism because
          of it.

          <h2>Manda Schank</h2>
          <img
            src="./img/manda2.jpg"
            alt="An anime-styled succubus character sticking up her middle finger at you with a bloody knife in the other hand."
          />
        </a>
        <p>
          For the 3rd artist, we have Manda Schank, a freelance artist in the
          games & comics industry. I really like Manda's character design & art
          style in general, her art is a bit more hard for me to describe
          exactly what I like about it.
